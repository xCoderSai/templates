# About ⚙️

I decided to create a few email (and eventually website) templates that seem legit, and have hyperlinks editable so you can put essentially any links, rickrolls, or memes you want to trick your friends and have fun. Many Sysadmins seem to use this or outsource email templates like these at a premium for internal usage. Was extremely hesitant to make this project but decided to because I believe in 🤑FREE🤑 resources. 

Some email templates include
- CHASE Bank 💵

- FedEX 🚚

- USPS 🚚

- Amazon, 💰 and more.

# Features
- Basic HTML and JS, with CSS formatting. Not that hard.

# The Future of this project
I plan on adding more as time passes, which will be listed below.

- Landing Pages 📃 of several famous and most often visited sites

- More e-mail 📧 templates for your perusal.
